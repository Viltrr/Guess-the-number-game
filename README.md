# Guess-the-number-game
I made this little project when I was 10 in Python, and rediscovered it recently. The code was quite simple, so I had fun making it a little more complex by adding levels and extra difficulties. Use this code to train in Python and try to understand how it works. The code is available in several versions, so you can train with the one that suits you best. I hope you enjoy it.
